Bubble Sort:

Advantages:

    Simple Implementation: Bubble sort boasts a straightforward and easy-to-understand implementation.
    In-Place Sorting: Operates in-place, utilizing only a constant amount of additional memory.

Disadvantages:

    Inefficiency: Exhibits poor time complexity, rendering it inefficient for large datasets when compared to more advanced algorithms like quicksort and mergesort.
    O(n^2) Time Complexity: Bubble sort's time complexity reaches O(n^2) in the worst case, proving impractical for sizable datasets.

Scenarios for Use:
Bubble sort finds suitability in small datasets or situations prioritizing simplicity over efficiency. Its adaptive nature allows it to perform well in nearly sorted arrays.

Quicksort:

Advantages:

    Efficiency: Demonstrates excellent average-case time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for substantial datasets.
    In-Place Sorting: Can be implemented to sort the array in-place, demanding only a logarithmic amount of additional memory.
    Adaptive: Adapts effectively to nearly sorted arrays, exhibiting efficient performance in practical scenarios.

Disadvantages:

    Not Stable: Lacks stability, potentially altering the relative order of equal elements.
    Worst-Case Time Complexity: Although its average-case time complexity is favorable, quicksort may reach O(n^2) in the worst-case scenario, albeit rarely with judicious pivot selection.

Scenarios for Use:
Quicksort stands out in scenarios involving large datasets or where high performance is a priority, commonly employed due to its efficiency across diverse situations.

Mergesort:

Advantages:

    Stable: Mergesort is a stable sorting algorithm, maintaining the relative order of equal elements.
    Predictable Performance: Exhibits consistent time complexity of O(n log n) regardless of input data, making it suitable for situations where predictable performance is crucial.
    Parallelizable: Easily parallelized, facilitating efficient sorting on multi-core or distributed systems.

Disadvantages:

    Additional Space: Requires extra memory proportional to the input array's size, making it less suitable for memory-constrained environments.

Scenarios for Use:
Mergesort is apt for scenarios demanding stable sorting and consistent performance, often employed in external sorting applications for sorting large files that exceed available memory.
