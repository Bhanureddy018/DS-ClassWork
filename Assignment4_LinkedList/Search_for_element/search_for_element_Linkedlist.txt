    Initiate from the Head: Start the search by positioning a pointer at the head of the linked list. This pointer will navigate through the list.

    Traverse the List: Use a loop to move through the linked list, node by node, until either finding the target element or reaching the list's end.

    Evaluate Each Node: At each node, compare the stored value with the target element being sought.

    Continue Until Discovery or End: If a match is found, the search is successful, and the iteration stops. Otherwise, proceed to the next node and repeat the process.

    Manage End of List: If the search concludes without locating the target element, it means the element isn't present in the list.

    Provide Outcome: Depending on the search result, return either the node containing the target element (if found) or a message indicating its absence.

    Conclude the Search: Terminate the search algorithm upon finding the target element or reaching the list's end.

This iterative approach systematically examines each node in the linked list until discovering the target element or exhausting the list, making it an efficient and dependable method for searching linked lists.
